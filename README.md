House Price Prediction

Overview

This project implements a House Price Prediction model using Linear Regression. The dataset includes features such as longitude, latitude, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and price. The goal is to predict house prices based on these attributes.

Dataset

The dataset consists of the following features:

Longitude: Geographic coordinate specifying the east-west position.

Latitude: Geographic coordinate specifying the north-south position.

Number of Rooms: Total number of rooms in the house.

Number of Bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms in the house.

Price: Target variable representing the house price.

Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Implementation Steps

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Feature scaling

Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing relationships between features

Identifying correlations

Model Training:

Applying Linear Regression model

Training and evaluating the model

Performance Evaluation:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared Score (R²)

Prediction & Visualization:

Predicting house prices on unseen data

Plotting actual vs. predicted prices

Usage

Run the following command to execute the model:

python house_price_prediction.py

Results

The model achieves a good prediction accuracy based on the test dataset. The performance metrics indicate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Future Enhancements

Implementing advanced models such as Random Forest and XGBoost.

Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

Deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.
